### Hi there üëã

Born and raised in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. I tried a bunch of hobbies but i found myself collecting boardgames and taking street photos.

I have been working with Software development since 2013, specially with frontend applications using React. Speaking of which, in 2015 i had the best experience creating the first Brazil React community at meetup platform. And through my writing, presentations and workshops, i was able to help a lot of people to learn new frontend technologies.

In my career, I had the opportunity to work with different types and sizes of projects.
